/**
 * This Alloy model represents a directed graph where nodes have outgoing edges. 
 * The graph can be analyzed for various properties such as being undirected, 
 * oriented, acyclic, complete, loop-free, weakly connected, strongly connected, 
 * and transitive. The predicates capture these graph properties using relational logic.
