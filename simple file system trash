/**
 * This Alloy model represents a simple file system trash can, with relational logic
 * used to define files, trash, and protected files. The model includes predicates
 * that describe various system properties, such as deletion, links between files, and 
 * protection statuses. The relational operators in Alloy help in defining and querying 
 * these relationships.
